#Netflix Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization
Overview:
This project involves loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from a Netflix dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The primary objective is to explore the dataset, derive meaningful insights, and prepare for potential machine learning tasks. Additionally, a Power BI dashboard is designed to present the key findings interactively.

Objective:
The main goals of this project are:
Import and clean the data.
Analyze trends and distributions within the dataset.
Visualize the findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Design a Power BI dashboard to extract and present key trends.
Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project includes information on Netflix's content library, including titles, genres, ratings, countries of production, and release dates. The initial step involves importing necessary libraries and modules to handle the data efficiently.

Technologies Used
Python Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Visualization Tool: Power BI

Data Cleaning Process:
To ensure accurate analysis, the following cleaning steps were performed:
Handling null values to maintain data integrity.
Checking and removing duplicate entries.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Several exploratory data analysis techniques were applied to understand the dataset better, including:

Country Content Distribution: Analyzing the geographical spread of Netflix's content.
Ratings Distribution: Investigating the distribution of content ratings.
Director Analysis: Identifying the top 10 directors contributing to Netflix's catalog.
Key Insights and Findings
Content Breakdown: Movies dominate (69.7%, 6126 titles), while TV Shows comprise 30.3% (2664 titles).
Top Genres: International Dramas, Documentaries, and Stand-Up Comedy are the most popular.
Production Trend: Significant growth in content production, especially post-2000.
Top Countries: USA, India, and the UK lead in content production.
Popular Directors: Rajiv Chilaka, Alastair Fothergill, Raul Campos, and Jan Suter.
Leading Content Ratings: TV-MA is the most common, followed by TV-14 and TV-PG.
Power BI Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard was designed to provide an interactive visualization of the following:

Content Distribution: 
Movies (92.08%) dominate the catalog compared to TV Shows (7.92%).
Top Genres:
Classic Movies, Action & Adventure, Dramas, and Stand-Up Comedy are the most popular.
Content Ratings:
TV-14 is the leading rating, followed by R and TV-MA.
Geographic Insights:
The United States leads content production (66.01%), followed by India and the UK.
Production Trends:
Significant growth post-1980, peaking after 2000.
Audience Targeting:
Mature ratings (TV-14, TV-MA) dominate, indicating a focus on adult audiences.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can shape content strategies, enhance audience engagement, and drive platform growth. The analysis revealed a significant surge in content production post-2000, reflecting Netflix's strategic global expansion. These insights can guide targeted content investments, cater to diverse audience preferences, and support Netflix's continued leadership in the streaming industry.
